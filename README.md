## General Info
This project was my first ever project I did on my own using html, css, and javaScript. This project was a great learning experience for me as I learned more about how to use DOM as well as how to handle events. I also had fun learning about the date and time methods in javaScript.

## Technologies
This project is created with:
* HTML
* CSS
* javaScript

## Features
I created a todo list that does more than just add items to a list. This Todo list has date and time functionality and allows the user to check items off as well as keep track of how many tasks are remaining
